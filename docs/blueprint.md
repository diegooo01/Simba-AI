# **App Name**: Simba Companion

## Core Features:

- UI Replication: Implement a responsive web app interface, replicating the original design of the Simba emotional support assistant.
- Sidebar Navigation: Design a left sidebar with 'Objectives,' 'My Profile,' and 'Configuration' options below the Simba logo.
- Emotional AI Assistant: Connect to the GPT API and implement an emotion-sensitive model that responds based on the emotional tone of user messages. The tool will make decisions based on the analysis of emotion of words and phrases.
- Emergency Redirection: Implement redirection to a specialized care line from the Psychology Department of UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES via a link if user messages indicate intense distress.  Link to:  https://psicologia.uniandes.edu.co/en/consulting-center

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light warm yellow (#FAF9F6) to provide a soft, comforting backdrop for the interface, as in the reference design.
- Primary color: Muted golden yellow (#FFDA63) for message bubbles and interactive elements to add warmth and visual interest, following the existing interface.
- Accent color: Light grayish-yellow (#E8E8E0) for Simba's message bubbles and sidebar elements, ensuring they blend well with the light background but remain distinct.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif known for blending modernity with a hint of warmth, will be used for all text elements, headlines, and body to ensure a readable, approachable aesthetic.
- Use simple, line-style icons for the sidebar navigation (Objectives, My Profile, Configuration) to maintain a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Employ a clean, bubble-style layout for messages, mirroring the provided interface, ensuring messages from the user are visually distinct from Simba's.
